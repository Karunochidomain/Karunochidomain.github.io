I'll be there with my friends at Haluminium Circle (check em' out: https://www.instagram.com/haluminiumcircle/).\n\nWe've been working on two big projects for these events: a Hololive fanzine and a Blue Archive artbook. Both will be available for purchase at the event or online, with pre-orders opening in early April. You can catch a glimpse of them in these pictures. More details will be shared soon!\n\n<img src=\"asset/blog/2025.03.26-gigi cecilia jiraikei__final cropped 2.png\" alt=\"gigi cecilia jiraikei__final cropped 2.png\" class=\"noSpill\">\n\nCute GG and CC!!

One of them is completing my Hololive fanbook project—a compilation of my artwork from 2023 til' now. The theme will be sleepwear, featuring cute Hololive VTubers lounging on beds kinda vibe. I've completed most of the pieces, but there are still many ideas I haven’t put on canvas yet. I'll be sharing updates on my social media, mainly on X/Twitter.\n\nAlso, I’ve finished this spring’s batch of commissions! I’ll stop taking commission requests until the end of May (though plans might change—I might open one or two slots in April!). Thank you to all my wonderful clients! Here are some of the pieces:\n\n<img src=\"asset/blog/2025.03.26-Shoomimi.png\" alt=\"Shoomimi.png\" class=\"noSpill\">\n\nFollow @Shoomimishoom on X/Twitter!\n\n<img src=\"asset/blog/2025.03.26-Rachie.png\" alt=\"Rachie.png\" class=\"noSpill\">\n\nThank you @awoogamart0947!\n\nWhat's more? I have so many ideas for music, but I will probably spill it all on a different blog. There all I can share right now, thank you for reading and have a nice day!.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\"Where are we going, Petrichor?\" I asked.\n\n\"Just trust me, and I will show you everything. Just\nfollow the steps.\"\n\nI followed her instructions, but I could not see anything\nahead of me.\n\n\"Do not look back\".\n\n\n","date":"2025.03.26","thumbnailURL":"asset/blog/2025.03.26-gigi cecilia jiraikei__final cropped 2.png","hidden":false}]
